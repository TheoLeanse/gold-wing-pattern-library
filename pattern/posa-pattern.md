title: POSA pattern
---
This form gets its name from the POSA book. Similarly to GOF it is a very structured and quite large form, although their headings are different: summary, example, context, problem, solution, structure, dynamics, implementation, example resolved, variants, known uses, consequences, and see also. The patterns are usually just over dozen pages in length. 

An important part of this form is that the patterns are preceded by a narrative chapter that summarises the patterns and describes the overall topic.
