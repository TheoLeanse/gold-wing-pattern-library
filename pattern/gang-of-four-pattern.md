The GOF form is the form used for the seminal Gang of Four book, that really launched patterns into the software world. 

It's a very structured form, breaking up the pattern into many headings: Intent, Motivation, Applicability, Structure, Participants, Collaborations, Consequences, Implementation, Sample Code, Known Uses, and Related Patterns. 

The GOF pattern are quite large, a dozen pages each.
